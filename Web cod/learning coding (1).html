                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Hunting and Feeding</strong>: Tigers spend a significant portion of their day hunting for prey, which includes deer, wild boar, and other large mammals. They rely on stealth and power to catch their food.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patrolling Territory</strong>: Tigers are territorial animals. They regularly patrol their territory to mark their boundaries with scent markings and to check for intruders.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resting and Sleeping</strong>: Tigers rest and sleep for several hours each day, often in shaded or secluded areas to conserve energy for hunting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grooming</strong>: Tigers groom themselves by licking their fur, which helps to keep it clean, remove parasites, and maintain their health.</li>
